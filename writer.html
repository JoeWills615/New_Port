                <br>

                <h5>There are all kinds of writers...including good ones and bad ones. For what I do, I am a
                    good one. I write for the spoken word, and the "rip & read" element of radio. The term "rip & read"
                    dates back to the early days of radio newscasts, when anchors would rip the latest incoming news off
                    the teletype and go directly on air with it. As radio has evolved, so has the "rip & read."
                    In today's world of radio, the fast-paced atmosphere has been combined with diminishing staff levels
                    at stations. Prep time has become more intense, so having a properly prepared content asset
                    available to the host is even more crucial now. </h5>
                <br>
                <h5>Writing for content and script, the style is very similar. It's about using short sentences, using
                    punctuation as visual cues, and making sure your information is structure in the proper sequence,
                    with all the needed details being included. Short sentences, so the read doesn't lose breath.
                    Punctuation, such as periods, exclamation points and question marks are easy to interpret.
                    ut a seasoned script writer, and reader, will look for commas as a place to take a breath,
                    ellipsis as a pause, and change of tone.
                </h5>
