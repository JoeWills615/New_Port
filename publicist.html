                <br>

                <h5>An Audio Publicist is a term I coined in 2017 to explain an aspect of
                    what I do when it comes to my company Production Content, Inc. From my experience
                    in working at a major record label and radio syndication company, press releases are a good way to
                    communicate information to radio stations and audio news outlets. But I discovered that
                    information is ingested, retained, and regurgitated better if the messaging is
                    in the form of a soundbite from the subject matter him/her self.</h5>


                <h5>So, when it comes to working with an artist, record label, or any client that
                    wants to convey information to an audio outlet, I have the skills and experience
                    to help you create a concise and effective message to the audience you want to reach.

                <h6><strong>KENNY CLOSES 2018 TRIP AROUND THE SUN TOUR IN BOSTON</strong></h6>
                <p1>With an opening video welcome from the New England Patriots organization that included Robert and
                    Jonathan Kraft, head coach Bill Belichick, quarterback Tom Brady, tight end Rob Gronkowski, wide
                    receiver Cordarrelle Patterson, offensive linemen Marcus Cannon and David Andrews, plus Patriots
                    Broadcast Analyst Scott Zolak and members of the Massachusetts State Police Mounted United, the
                    greater Boston area was all in for Kenny's 18th and 19th shows at Gillette Stadium. With two night
                    attendance of 121,714 as Kenny's team worked to make more tickets available this morning the 8-time
                    Entertainer of the Year not only broke his own attendance record, but he surpassed the million
                    ticket mark by over 90,000.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p1>This is so much bigger than all of us, Kenny told Saturday nights crowd. Its like destiny.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Certainly the man Variety called Country musics only true long-term stadium act and The Wall Street
                    Journal deemed The New England Patriots Other Star hit the stage both nights intent on rocking the
                    packed stadium with everything he had. By the time guitarist Kenny Greenberg swooped in to a vamp on
                    Bachman Turner Overdrives Taking Care of Business in the show opening Beer In Mexico, the East
                    Tennessee songwriter/superstar was covered in sweat from racing from one side of the 40 foot strut
                    to the other. Throwing himself at the music, the audience cheered often for 40, 60, 90 seconds
                    between songs and sang the songs back with a fervor that pushed the energy even higher.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>This entire summer has been a new threshold in terms of how No Shoes Nation has come at these songs,
                    these shows, these moments, reflected the man who just notched his 30th No. 1 Billboard Country
                    single. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better, something else would happen… And then we
                    saw a whole new response, whether it was the cheers, the way the audiences sang or the looks on
                    peoples faces. It was incredible.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Invoking Robert Kraft's philosophy that sports, music and traditions bring people together, the only
                    country artist on Pollstar's Mid-Year Top 10 Tours thanked the assembled audience for allowing him
                    to become one of their traditions. Sharing the love of sports and music, Kenny closed both nights
                    with The Boys of Fall, his ode to the honor code of high school football players everywhere.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>He also played (She Comes from) Boston both nights. Saturday, he brought millionth ticket purchaser
                    Karen Duggan on stage, explaining that she represented each and every one of them before performing
                    the song about the island dwelling expat to the capacity crowd.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>The spirit of the people of Boston have been part of this journey since the first year we started
                    playing stadiums. They love life, they work hard, they believe in music and they understand how much
                    I see their lives in my own life. I never believed when I was young that I would play, let alone
                    sell out the stadium where the Patriots play. But when I hear those voices as I hit that stage, I'm
                    sure glad unthinkable dreams come true.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Over a dozen years, Kenny rocked 1,090,326 people across 19 shows in Boston. Kenny also had another
                    platinum summer. With just under 1.3 million total attendance, he racked up 1,298,088 tickets sold
                    across 19 stadiums and 41 total shows on his Trip Around the Sun Tour.</p1>

                <h6><strong>KENNY CHESNEY: What A Trip!</strong></h6>
                <p1>Kenny Chesney‘s 2018 Trip Around The Sun tour wrapped up in Foxboro, Massachusetts this weekend at
                    Gillette stadium with the final two shows of the year. </p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Starting back in April, Kenny set out on a tour that would cover 41 shows, including 19 stadiums,
                    and entertain a total attendance of 1,298,088–nearly 1.3 million people! </p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>The final destination for his tours over the last several years has been the double shot of shows at
                    Gillette stadium, right outside of Boston. Normally after his last show of the tour, Kenny would
                    head back to his bus, hotel or even his dressing room at the stadium to record a thought about the
                    end of the tour. </p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Not this year!</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>Kenny was so fired up, that just to the side of the stage he recorded his thoughts on the Trip
                    Around The Sun tour. Kenny believes there was a real magic surrounding the shows this year, and it
                    was not only one of the greatest summers he’s had as an artist, but one of the greatest experiences
                    of his life. Then with the crowd still going wild in the stadium behind him, Kenny carried his
                    recorder on stage to capture the moment in Foxboro, and end the 2018 Trip Around The Sun tour with
                    his fans.</p1>

                </h1>
                <br>
                <p1>Tradional press releases are infrequent and may only be sent out once or twice a month,
                    and that's only if there is major breaking news. Sometimes it can be 6 to 8 weeks between
                    press releases.
                </p1>
                <p1>In the world of Audio Publicity, a story can go out once a week. This allows you to better
                    guide and control the message you want to convey. It keeps you fresh in the news cycle and
                    with the sound bite arriving each week, it builds a better connection with your outlets,
                    and there by the audience they are sharing your information with. The stories that accompany
                    the sound bite are shorter and more topical, allowing "bite-size" bits of information to be
                    placed into the marketplace, which feeds on the ability of your audience to capture and
                    retain information.
